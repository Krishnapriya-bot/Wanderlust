# Wanderlust
Travel Website

Wanderlust is a frontend-only travel website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to showcase the rich diversity of India. It features predefined itineraries, and religious heritage sites like temples, mosques and churches and a sample hotel booking section.

Note: 
This is a static concept project with no backend. 
The hotel booking section is for demonstration purposes only and does not use real booking data.
